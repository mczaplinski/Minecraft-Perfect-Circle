Minecraft Perfect Circle Tool v1.0
Open Source Project under GNUv3 license: https://github.com/mczaplinski/Minecraft-Perfect-Circle

The provided files are tested and build under Windows. If you plan to use this tool on Linux or any other machine, clone the github repository and build it yourself :)

Tutorial:

1. Start MinecraftCircleTool.exe in the bin/ folder
2. Type the diameter of your desired circle (integer, even or uneven)
3. Type the roundness factor:
	min: 0, max: 0.499, best: 0.275
	It is hard to find the optimal decision for blocks on the outer edge of the circle.
	For small diameters, this value can shape your circle slightly into the direction of a square or a star.
	The optimal circle is something in between. Some may find smaller or higher values more desirable.
	From experimentation we find 0.25 or 0.275 to be a good value.
	We don't want to hardcode this decision but provide you the opportunity to shape YOUT circle into something you have always dreamed of.
4. The output will be saved into a .txt file for later referencing.
5. Have fun and spread the word!
